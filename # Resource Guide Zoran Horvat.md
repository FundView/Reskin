# Resource Guide: Zoran Horvat (Coding Helmet)

## Overview

Zoran Horvat is a .NET-focused software architect, consultant, and trainer associated with Coding Helmet and a catalog of long-form articles, exercises, and video courses. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
His public materials frequently center on object-oriented design, refactoring-driven thinking, testability, and functional techniques in C#. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
Coding Helmet serves as the primary index for written content and practice problems, while Pluralsight and Udemy host structured course offerings. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
Supporting pages on GitHub and community platforms (e.g., Ko-fi, Patreon) provide additional context, source code, and ongoing work streams. ([GitHub][2])
This guide curates his official materials alongside authoritative references that align with recurring themes across his catalog.
Nothing here constitutes professional, legal, or financial advice; links are provided for informational discovery.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide groups resources by format (articles, exercises, courses, code) and by recurring technical themes. Links are primarily official publisher pages and first-party references, with a smaller set of contextual standards and documentation. Descriptions are intentionally brief to support scanning and comparison.

## Source Quality Notes

CodingHelmet.com, Pluralsight, Udemy, and GitHub are treated as primary sources for Horvat’s materials and associated code. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
Redirect links (e.g., `codinghelmet.com/go/...`) were supplied; where possible, this guide points to direct destination pages to reduce tracking and ambiguity. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
Social platforms are not included in the curated link lists, even when they host primary announcements or mirrors; user-provided handles were: `youtube.com/@zoran-horvat`, `linkedin.com/in/zoran-horvat`, `twitter.com/zoranh75`.
When older course pages are labeled “retired,” availability and catalog placement may vary over time. ([Pluralsight][3])

## Signature Themes Across the Catalog

Horvat’s catalog repeats certain conceptual threads across different formats: design constraints, refactoring as a reasoning tool, and expressiveness in C# across paradigms. ([codinghelmet.com][13])
The same topics often appear as an article, a course segment, and a code artifact, creating multiple “views” of similar ideas.
This section groups resources by theme to reduce duplication across platform boundaries.
The links emphasize representative starting points rather than exhaustive coverage.

### Object-Oriented Design and Patterns

A large portion of the catalog presents object orientation as a vehicle for controlling complexity and change. ([codinghelmet.com][1])
Patterns are typically treated as outcomes of design pressure, rather than as a checklist to apply. ([Udemy][28])
Several items focus on edges of inheritance, construction, and responsibility distribution. ([codinghelmet.com][10])

* [Udemy: Beginning OOP with C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-object-oriented-programming-with-c/) — Introductory framing of OO fundamentals. ([Udemy][26])
* [Udemy: Design Patterns in C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-c-sharp-made-simple/) — Patterns explained through C# implementations. ([Udemy][27])
* [Coding Helmet: Chain of Responsibility Composition](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/object-composition-using-chain-of-responsibility) — Composition pattern used as dependency structure. ([codinghelmet.com][17])
* [Coding Helmet: Virtual Calls in Constructors](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/here-is-why-calling-a-virtual-function-from-the-constructor-is-a-bad-idea) — Inheritance pitfall explained with examples. ([codinghelmet.com][10])
* [Pluralsight: Tactical Patterns—Managing Responsibilities](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/tactical-design-patterns-dotnet-managing-responsibilities) — Responsibility allocation across collaborating objects. ([Pluralsight][25])

### Functional Techniques in C#

Functional topics often appear as pragmatic tools for controlling branching, state mutation, and null handling. ([codinghelmet.com][13])
Option/Maybe constructs and immutable modeling recur as mechanisms for making invalid states unrepresentable. ([codinghelmet.com][13])
The course material presents functional features as part of modern C# evolution rather than a separate ecosystem. ([Pluralsight][21])

* [Pluralsight: Functional C# 10](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/c-sharp-10-functional) — Functional idioms in modern C#. ([Pluralsight][21])
* [Pluralsight: Writing Purely Functional Code in C# 7](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/writing-purely-functional-code-csharp) — Functional purity discussed via C# examples. ([Pluralsight][31])
* [Coding Helmet: Option/Maybe Implementation](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/custom-implementation-of-the-option-maybe-type-in-cs) — Optionality as a first-class construct. ([codinghelmet.com][13])
* [Coding Helmet: Avoid Returning Null](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/avoid-returning-null) — Alternatives to null-based absence signaling. ([codinghelmet.com][16])
* [Coding Helmet: OO and FP “Equality”](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/what-makes-functional-and-object-oriented-programming-equal) — Conceptual comparison across paradigms. ([codinghelmet.com][32])

### Testability, Refactoring, and Maintainability

Testing is framed as a consequence of design choices rather than an afterthought. ([Pluralsight][22])
Refactoring appears as a method of clarifying structure while keeping behavioral intent stable. ([Udemy][28])
Metrics and tooling are used selectively as signals for structural stress and dependency issues. ([codinghelmet.com][15])

* [Pluralsight: Improving Testability Through Design](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/improving-testability-through-design) — Design properties tied to testability. ([Pluralsight][22])
* [Pluralsight: Writing Highly Maintainable Unit Tests](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/writing-highly-maintainable-unit-tests) — Unit tests as maintainable code assets. ([Pluralsight][33])
* [Coding Helmet: Unit Testing Median](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/unit-testing-case-study-calculating-median) — Testing case study with design implications. ([codinghelmet.com][12])
* [Udemy: Refactoring to Design Patterns](https://www.udemy.com/course/refactoring-to-design-patterns/) — Refactoring narrative converging toward patterns. ([Udemy][28])
* [Coding Helmet: Coupling and Instability Metrics](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/how-to-measure-module-coupling-and-instability-using-ndepend) — Dependency metrics as refactoring signals. ([codinghelmet.com][15])

### Data Structures and Algorithmic Thinking

Exercises and kata-style repositories surface algorithmic thinking as a complement to architectural design. ([codinghelmet.com][4])
These resources often emphasize reasoning about complexity, invariants, and correctness, not just implementation. ([codinghelmet.com][34])
They also provide concrete artifacts that can be compared across alternative implementations.
The selections below are representative of the broader exercises index.

* [Exercises Index](https://codinghelmet.com/exercises) — Full set of exercises and problems. ([codinghelmet.com][4])
* [Exercise: Max Value in Queue](https://codinghelmet.com/exercises/finding-maximum-value-in-queue) — Queue design with constant-time max query. ([codinghelmet.com][34])
* [Exercise: Prime Factorization](https://codinghelmet.com/exercises/prime-factorization) — Integer decomposition and reasoning about divisibility. ([codinghelmet.com][35])
* [Exercise: Sudoku Solver](https://codinghelmet.com/exercises/sudoku-solver) — Constraint solving via state and backtracking. ([codinghelmet.com][36])
* [Repo: sudoku-kata](https://github.com/zoran-horvat/sudoku-kata) — Refactoring target centered on Sudoku logic. ([GitHub][2])
* [Repo: advent-of-code-2024](https://github.com/zoran-horvat/advent-of-code-2024) — Seasonal exercise set with published solutions. ([GitHub][2])

## Talks, Slides, and Speaker Listings

Conference and slide artifacts can provide “compressed” versions of recurring themes and vocabulary.
They may also reveal topic drift over time (e.g., architecture tradeoffs, language evolution, tool-assisted development).
This section intentionally favors stable slide-host pages rather than social reposts.
Event listings should be treated as partial and time-bound.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

Across platforms, recurring cross-cutting ideas include managing complexity through explicit constraints, keeping codebases evolvable, and treating design choices as tradeoffs rather than absolutes. ([codinghelmet.com][15])
Community participation and open-source hosting introduce licensing and conduct considerations that sit outside purely technical content.
Course platforms also add access constraints (subscriptions, catalog changes, “retired” labels) that affect long-term availability. ([Pluralsight][3])
